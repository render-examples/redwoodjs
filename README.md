# Redwood

> **WARNING:** RedwoodJS software has not reached a stable version 1.0 and should not be considered suitable for production use. In the "make it work; make it right; make it fast" paradigm, Redwood is in the later stages of the "make it work" phase.

## Getting Started
- [Tutorial](https://redwoodjs.com/tutorial/welcome-to-redwood): getting started and complete overview guide.
- [Docs](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/introduction): using the Redwood Router, handling assets and files, list of command-line tools, and more.
- [Redwood Community](https://community.redwoodjs.com): get help, share tips and tricks, and collaborate on everything about RedwoodJS.

### Setup

We use Yarn as our package manager. To get the dependencies installed, just do this in the root directory:

```terminal
yarn install
```

### Fire it up

```terminal
yarn redwood dev
```

Your browser should open automatically to `http://localhost:8910` to see the web app. Lambda functions run on `http://localhost:8911` and are also proxied to `http://localhost:8910/.redwood/functions/*`.

## Deploy Redwood to Render

This is a sample [Redwood](https://redwoodjs.com/) app, configured for deployment to [Render](https://render.com). It consists of a static site, an API, and a managed PostgreSQL database.

The Render setup was automatically generated by running:

`yarn rw setup deploy render`

See [Deploy Redwood JS](https://render.com/docs/deploy-redwood) for detailed deployment instructions.
